__Macros4Cuke__ is a Cucumber extension that allows you create and use new Cucumber steps without programming.
    
  With it, your scenarios will:  
- become shorter since a macro-step can replace a bunch of sub-steps,
- be more expressive by hiding low-level and boring details inside higher-level macro-steps,
- be more flexible thanks to conditional steps you can put in a macro-step.
